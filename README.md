This repository presents the work described in “Design and Analysis of a Low Power Conditional Capture Flip-Flop in 32 nm CMOS.” The paper proposes a low-power Conditional Capture Flip-Flop (CCFF) that integrates explicit data-dependent clock gating to significantly reduce unnecessary clock switching activity. Unlike conventional master–slave flip-flops and traditional CCFF designs where the clock toggles unconditionally, the proposed architecture enables the clock only when the input data differs from the stored output, using an XOR-based gating condition. The design is implemented and evaluated at the transistor level in 32 nm PTM low-power CMOS technology with a 1.0 V supply, and validated through both pre-layout and post-layout SPICE simulations. Results demonstrate near-zero clock power, substantial reduction in total dynamic power, preserved negative setup time, and minimal timing degradation after parasitic extraction, making the proposed CCFF well suited for energy-constrained and low-activity digital systems
